## Priorities:

### Documentation:

* Documentating the API is very important to the project; contributing to pygame documentation can be a very good entry point to get acquainted with the project, understand the code, and gear up to further contributions.

### Open Issues:

* Open issues are a great source of ideas to contribute to pygame.
    * If you find an issue that reports a problem. You can try to reproduce the error, and document the steps. This process helps locate and isolate the bug in certain parts of the code, or files of the project; this reveals valuable information for you, or others to fix it.
    * Issues triage, and allocation of tags will help all contributors.

## Report issues:

For reporting issues, bugs, or problems, use the issue-tracker. Please, first check previous issues using filter, to avoid duplicated reports.
